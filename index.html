    <h3> Our Mission </h3>
    <p> Technology is a powerful tool. But taking into account that kids are living in their teenage world of social media accounts, and grandparents are demanding technological instruction to impress their friends, it can feel as if technology is tearing your family apart! Kids are at risk of seeing themselves as unloved and ignored while their elder counterparts feel confused and left behind. </p>

 

<p> Now, there’s a solution. </p>

 

<p> Centered around our passion for grandparents and those around them, the Our Grandparents & Us website is built to satisfy grandparents’ need-to-know feelings through fun and interactive activities made to be enjoyed with their grandkids! Meanwhile, we provide parents guidance and comfort through weekly blog posts as kids get the chance learn about conditions and diseases and how to create the best kind of memories with those they love. </p>

​

<p> I was inspired to create this website because of my experiences with my grandpa, whom we called Opa. When I was in 1st grade and when my brother was barely in existence, our Opa suffered a stroke. After that, he was never the same. The energetic, strong, know-all grandpa suddenly became a bedridden, sickly, speechless man with a diaper. Despite the boundaries, my amazing mom still managed to forge a loving and strong relationship between my brother, me and Opa. After years of valiantly fighting his illnesses, Opa passed away last year.</p>

​

<p> With this website, I hope to give other kids a chance to have the more of experience I never could really have. Technology doesn’t have to be the barrier between our generations. </p> <p> With Our Grandparents & Us, no elderly or kid will be left behind! </p>
